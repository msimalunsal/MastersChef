The website I created in MVC structure with ASP.Net and Microsoft SQL server within the scope of Windows based web programming course.

Some screenshots taken from the Website:

I included 3 kitchens in my project. These are Italian Cuisine, Turkish Cuisine and Far Eastern Cuisine. I have embedded the courses of each cuisine on my site with videos on youtube. I also added 3 videos for each course series. When I want to add a new course to the site, doing these through the database will help automate it. In the project, users will be able to access the course content. In case they attend the course, the next course will be opened as they progress through the courses. Classes in the form of live (Stream) broadcast will not take place. 'About' page, 'Courses' page, 'Profile' page on the website
will be found. In addition, logging in, logging out and registering will be done. Information about the website will be given in the About section. The training page will include the details of the course and information about the training before joining the course. If he participates in the training, the first of the course videos are open, the others are locked.
videos will appear on the page. Once the user completes the video, the next course will also be unlocked and the user can move on to another tutorial. On the 'Profile' page, they will be able to follow the progress of their training and log out. Another feature added to the Website is that users cannot access courses without logging in.
